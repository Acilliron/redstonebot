The open source bot built for KoGGC.

When asking for help, read the manual, do your research and provide details for those you are asking for assistance. When offering help, be as patient and tactful as possible. Our contributors are volunteers, they do not get paid for this. Please be very respectful towards them.  Anti-social or offensive behaviour will not be tolerated. Simply put, treat others as you would be treated; respect them and their views, even if you disagree with them. When you do find yourself disagreeing; please give respectful evidence to help prove your point, do not attack the other person’s viewpoint directly.
 
A person who intentionally attempts to disrupt, cause controversy, incite an argument, and/or receive negative attention by deliberately posting provocative content. The term may also refer to the act of posting such content, or the content itself. Trolls are generally deceitful and often use ambivalence as a method of covertly insulting, intimidating, or inciting a person or persons for their own sadistic pleasure. They often pick their words very carefully and are therefore able to defend their masked attempts at creating unrest, frequently redirecting the blame onto the community and its supposed failure to understand them properly. This behavior is strictly prohibited. Also, impersonation is strictly prohibited.
 
Moderators and Administrators have been chosen for their ability to exercise consistently good judgement and shall have the final say. This forum is not run as a democracy. The staff shall always attempt to implement universally peaceful solutions, but in the end, are charged with the responsibility of maintaining peaceful, civil order for the majority of the community. Therefore, they cannot always please everyone with the decisions made. Please do your part to contribute to a healthy community and environment.
 
Posting a single word or useless message (bumping) to attract attention to your thread is not allowed. Do your own research, continue to troubleshoot, post the results, and be patient with the community. If people are reading your thread without answering or offering help, you may try supplying more details, or ask to be pointed in the right direction. Often, the reason for posts remaining unanswered is due in large part to the sparse details in the original post itself, or, the obvious availability of solutions on the forum or on the web, and the community's unwillingness to point out the obvious. 
 
Discussions stating the equivalent of "there is a problem with the system and methodology, we need to discuss it" have been repeatedly proven ineffective and inflammatory and will usually be closed down after a warning from the support staff. If you have identified a systemic issue, find a solution that works for you, implement it, then post. Furthermore, questioning or discussing the methods used by the development team will be monitored closely and locked or removed if deemed unhelpful and/or unproductive. Harsh, unproductive criticism is also uncalled for.
 
Issue-related posts
If you have a question regarding an issue, please ensure that your topic poses a specific question and be open-minded to responses. If possible, provide a solution or partial solution. Submitting troubleshooting methods for discussion is always more practical than asking others to do it for you.
On these types of posts, do not reply to a post with a I had this problem too or similar statement without also posting what you found out (i.e. I had this problem too! Pls help!) If you don’t have a solution or key details, don’t post. Instead, use upvote so we can see how many people need this topic reviewed.



Enforcement of the rules
If the staff  feel that a member's behavior is unacceptable and warrants intervention, a warning will typically be issued unless the occurrence is judged to be especially flagrant, in which case a ban may be issued immediately. Warnings will not be discussed on the forums, Discord channels, or mailing lists by the staff. If the warning goes unheeded, further action will be taken. This may range from muting the user to banning of the user, out of consideration for a peaceful forum and community. Action is generally on a case-by-case basis.
If you need to make an appeal about a punishment, or if you feel that an egregious oversight has been made, or you need to alert staff to abusive behaviour, contact a staff member.

Please DO NOT make a post on the forum. Other users do not need to be made aware of these issues. If a problem arises, message a staff member and we will handle it.
